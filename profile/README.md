# Baba Vanga

This project demonstrates a decentralized prediction market built on the native Bitcoin network using Glittr. Our system leverages Automated Market Makers (AMMs) â€” specifically a Constant Sum Market Maker (CSMM) model â€” to provide continuous liquidity and dynamic pricing for binary outcome tokens. An off-chain oracle is integrated to resolve market outcomes based on real-world data.

## Overview

- **Prediction Market:**  
  Users create markets on questions like "Will Bitcoin reach 125K USD by March?" and mint outcome tokens (YES and NO) to represent the possible outcomes.

- **AMMs (CSMM):**  
  Instead of an order book, our system deploys an AMM based on the CSMM model. With this model, the sum of the outcome prices is always fixed (e.g., $1), so that the price of each token directly reflects the market's estimated probability.

- **Oracle Integration:**  
  At market resolution, an off-chain oracle fetches data (e.g., BTC/USD price) and generates a signed oracle commitment. This commitment is included in the resolution transaction, ensuring that the market outcome is determined by verified external data.

## Protocol Advancements for Custom AMM CSMM

Recent protocol advancements have enhanced our custom AMM CSMM, delivering increased flexibility and efficiency to our prediction market ecosystem. These improvements include:

- **Custom Configuration:**  
  The system now supports customizable parameters for the CSMM model, allowing market creators to adjust fee structures and liquidity parameters to better reflect market dynamics.

- **Enhanced Liquidity and Dynamic Pricing:**  
  The updated protocol introduces improvements in the liquidity mechanism. This ensures a smoother price discovery process with dynamic adjustments that maintain the invariant sum of outcome prices while accommodating varying levels of market participation.

- **Optimized Oracle Integration:**  
  With the revised integration, the off-chain oracle now offers faster and more accurate resolution of market outcomes. This ensures that price feeds (such as BTC/USD) are captured with enhanced reliability and incorporated into market resolutions seamlessly.

- **Robust and Scalable Architecture:**  
  The protocol advancements address scalability and security, providing a more robust framework to support higher transaction volumes and more complex market scenarios. This positions the platform to handle an expanding user base and more diverse prediction market queries.
